## Report Parser
Convert JSON report into word document.

The script takes `.json` file as input which is given from variable `file_name` and creates a table by taking selected fields and their values. Currently the script is configured to parse the JSON report generated by [ZeusCloud](https://www.zeuscloud.io/)

Currently the script is in initial phase of development. Hence, there's no command line support and we have to configure the script according to our need by editing the `parse_report.py`
